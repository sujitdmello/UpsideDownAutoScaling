# Upside Down Auto Scaling in Cloud Services

Most modern Cloud Services support auto-scaling but these services are slow to spin-up. This approach to setting up the scaling rules helps to achieve better application performance.

## The Scenario

In the era of serverless computing, scaling up and down of cloud services/resources is not something we take mmuch time thinking about. It is assumed that the cloud provider has pre-provisioned extra resources to meet the demands such that any sudden scaling up of resources will happen in a few seconds. That is the price we pay for serverless compute (by-the-second).

However for other traditional cloud services such as VMs, Web Apps, Kubernetes, HPC, Hadoop etc., essentially all the services that charge you by the VM and therefore require spinning up new VMs to meet your application demads, the time taken to scale up can be in the order of a few minutes if not more. This is a problem for applications that are trying to ramp up at the star of a business day or meet sudden demands in traffic based on seasonal or other factors.

### Traditional Scaling Rules 

Most cloud resources can be setup with scaling rules. These rules can react to increases in CPU, Memory, Disk I/O or even the length of a worker queue. When the increase is observed over a period of a few minutes, certain actions can be taken. The typical scaling rule may be something like: 

```
When Average CPU over 10 minutes > 70%, scale UP by 1 instance
When Average CPU over 10 minutes < 30%, scale DOWN by 1 instance 
```
The problem with this approach is that each reaction to the increase in CPU takes a few minutes before the additional instance is up and running. During this time the system is likely under some pressure. When the additional instance is added to the pool of servers, the systm may stabalize temperorily before it comes under some additional load. Once again the scaling rules will result in an additional instance being spun up, which make take a few more minutes and again causing the system to be uner some pressure. This cycle continues each tme the system is scaled up.

### The alternative approach

The scaling rules can be made a bit more aggressive such that when the CPU increases beyond some threshold, a number of instances (perhaps the maximum you are willing to request) are added. 

So the rule may be something like

```
When Average CPU over 5 minutes > 40%, scale UP by 10 instances
When Average CPU over 30 minutes < 30%, scale DOWN by 1 instance

```

What does this do? Well it results in a very aggressive scale up and a conservative scale down. The advantage of this approach is that the overhead of scaling up the VMs is incurred all at one time. So within a few minutes you have more capacity than you may ever need. On the surface this may appear to be a waste of resources and money but this is not a bad thing as it has given the business more than enough to account for any load over the next several minutes. And in case the system does not require all that capacity, well in about 30 minutes it will start dropping instances one at a time. This will continue until the system reaches a level of instances that is a appropriate for the load. So in stead of scaling **up** one at a time until we get to a steady state, we scale **down** one at a time.
